# Horieson-Website

## Description

The motive of this challenge was to refractor the code to increase accessibility, and overall cleanliness of the code 


## Installation

Using the starter code. I went in and made sure everything works. I found a couple redundant css attributes which I was able to get rid of, and keep the website the same. I fixed the code for the search engine optimization button so that it redirects the user to the specified spot on the webpage. 


## Credits
I used coding cheat sheets so that I can remember tags, and attributes.
